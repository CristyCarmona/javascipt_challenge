## Title:
UFO Sightings

## Description:
ALIENS-R-REAL has collected all of the eye-witness UFO Sightings and they need to put this information online for the world to see. 
So, this project is about writing code that will create a table dynamically based upon a given dataset. It's also needed to allow the 
users to filter the table data for specific values such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.
